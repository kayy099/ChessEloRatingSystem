# ChessEloRatingSystem
The Elo rating system is a mathematical method used to calculate the relative skill levels of players in zero-sum games such as Chess. 
Developed an in-house framework to assign numerical ratings to players effectively. 
Proposed for integration into the institute's chess society, this system offers a localized performance assessment for IIIT students.
